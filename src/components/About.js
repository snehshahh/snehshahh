          I'm a full-stack developer who loves turning ideas into fully functional websites and applications. 
          Whether it's building a sleek front-end or ensuring the back-end runs like a well-oiled machine,
          I thrive on bringing concepts to life online. When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing musicâ€”
          it's my favorite way to unwind and fuel my creativity. From tech to tunes, I like to keep things dynamic.
